# **2021 BB Workshop Documentation**
This repo contains the documentation for the 2021 Virtual Workshop. 

## Goal
The goal of this workshop is to create a competitive robot for the New Englan Alliance Antics The Recharge game (see [Game](#Game) section below).

## Pre-requisites
It is assumed that you already have a Romi robot, fully assembled, and some supplies (TODO: ADD LINK HERE FOR EXAMPLES). We will try to make this document as self-guiding as possible but some experience will be assumed. If you have questions, please leverage your coaches and mentors as well as our office hours.

## Setup Romi Networking
It is recommended that you connect your Romi through your local wifi network in order to connect the robot, and leverage your computer for Zoom or other virtual communication and screen sharing. Please follow the installation documentation [BB Workshop Network Instructions](./BB%20Workshop%20Network%20Instructions.md)

# Intro to the Romi
The official [Wpilib Romi documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html) is the best place to start. Additionally, to see a quick video on the background of workshops and a little more info about the Romi hardware, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3hX-cEsVwM&t=1207s). 

## <a name="Game"></a>Game
The game we will be building for is called [Alliance Antics The Recharge](https://wpilib.org/blog/alliance-antics-the-recharge). 

## Recommended approach
You will get a chance to create and design robots basically from scratch to participate in this competition. Have fun prototyping different ideas to determine their feasibility. Once you feel confident about a particular design, start coding to command the robot to behave as you demostated with your prototype.

## Anatomy of a robot
In particular, you should become familar with what options you have for inputs and outputs of your robot. Outputs, which we call actuators, are used to make the robot move or behave a certain way. The actuators we will use are motors. In our case, we have motors for the wheels. Servo motors are useful for adding additional motion (such as raising/lowing an arm, opening/closing gates, or rotating a conveyor belt). Inputs to our robot are called sensors. This is ways for us to programatically understand our environment. Examples are limit switches, encoders, gyroscopes, or cameras. For more information on actuators and sensors, please see:

## Office Hours
We will have office hours where you can come and ask questions between 4:00 - 6:00 p.m. EST, Nov. 8th-11th and Nov. 15th-18th. Please join using this [TODO: Zoom link]()

## Mini-competition Weekend
To have some additional fun, we will hold our own competion before the Dec. 4th New England challenge. This will be held Nov. 20th from 10:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m EST.
